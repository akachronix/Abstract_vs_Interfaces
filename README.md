Only the supercharged Intellisense was used in terms of AI. Did not use prompts or the chat function. Corrected variable names, clerical errors, and if the AutoComplete was irrelevant I didn't use it.

- The interface version is better as it is more scalable with the trade off of being a bit too loaded with files for my taste. I hate having 3 line files of code but such is the nature of Java. 

### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is more useful in the abstract implementation as well
